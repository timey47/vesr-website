        <h2>Industry Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The finance industry focuses on managing money, investments, banking, and financial planning.
            It plays an important role in helping individuals, businesses, and governments make decisions
            about saving, spending, and investing. Finance supports economic growth and helps people plan
            for their future.

        <h2>Career of Interest</h2>
        <p>
            A career in finance that interests me is a Financial Analyst. Financial analysts study market
            trends, company performance, and financial data to help organizations make informed decisions.
            They often work with budgets, forecasts, and investment strategies.
        </p>

        <h2>Ethical Issue in Finance</h2>
        <p>
            One ethical issue in the finance industry is the misuse of confidential financial information.
            Financial professionals often have access to sensitive data such as bank account information,
            credit history, and investment plans. Using this information for personal gain or sharing it
            without permission is unethical and can seriously harm clients.
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Values and Ethics</h2>
        <p>
            My personal values include honesty, responsibility, and integrity. These values guide how I
            would respond to ethical issues in finance. I believe it is important to protect client
            information, follow ethical guidelines, and make decisions that are fair and trustworthy.
        </p>

        <h2>Cybersecurity Issues in Finance</h2>
        <p>
            The finance industry is a major target for cyberattacks because it stores valuable financial
            data. Common cybersecurity issues include data breaches, identity theft, phishing attacks,
            and ransomware. These attacks can cause financial losses and damage trust between companies
            and customers.
        </p>

        <h2>Cybersecurity Best Practices</h2>
        <p>
            To protect sensitive information, financial organizations use cybersecurity best practices
            such as strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, data encryption, and regular security
            updates. Training employees on cybersecurity awareness also helps reduce the risk of attacks.
